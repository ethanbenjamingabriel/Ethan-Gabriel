ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Ethan Gabriel, nice to meet you! I recently completed my 3rd co-op term at Zoocasa as an Automation Engineer, designing UI tests in Cypress, front-end tests in Jest, back-end unit tests in Go, and back-end development in Go for the company website and mobile app. I am in my 2B Term of Honours Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo and I am seeking a co-op placement for the Winter 2024 term. 

ðŸ‘€ I am currently participating in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Society, at the University of Waterloo, as the Vice President of Academics, organizing events such as peer mentorship, resume critique, and interview prep sessions for the department of ECE. 

ðŸŒ± I am a level 9 pianist and a double degree black belt in Taekwondo. My hobbies include programming, solving difficult mathematical problems, exploring new technology, and watching car reviews. As a passionate communicator, logical thinker, and leader, I am determined to enhance my skills through every situation that comes my way. I am looking forward to meeting new people and learning new skills!
